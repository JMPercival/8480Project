## CYBR 8480 Project Milestone 1

### Executive Summary
The original idea revolved around trying to create a keylogger using the accelerometer in my mbientlab device. After putting some thought into it, that turned out to be way beyond the scope. So it was decided that I would attempt to create a device that would detect whether a person was typing, writing, or using a mouse. The goal is currently just to get to the point where I would be able to accurately determine which of these were happening. If this goal comes easier than imagined, the project would pivot to either trying to detect more things, and/or creating a nice graphical interface for a user. This could potentially be very useful in an intelligence community because it would allow for the profiling of the person being watched. Granted, knowing what they are typing or writing is much more handy, but at least this is a start. 

Honestly, this does not really help anyone except for myself for now. This is a good learning experience and I am going to use it as such. The project is interesting because it allows myself (and potentially others) to dip their toes in the water and take the first steps to using an accelerometer for more interesting activities.. That being said, it very well could be taken to the next level using AI to try to figure out what a user is doing inside each of the major catagories I defined. These could be called sub-catagories and would boil down to activities such as what the user is typing and where the mouse is going. That is when this information becomes incredibly useful to either someone watching their own desk, or an advesary trying to sniff out information. 

#### Goals:
1. Program device to sit on a desk and send data back to a phone
1. Program a phone to recieve data and show output to user
1. Determine if a user is typing
1. Determine if a user is writing
1. Determine if a user if using the mouse (mousing?)
